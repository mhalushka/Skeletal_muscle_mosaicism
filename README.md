# Skeletal_muscle_mosaicism
R codes related to Seurat and SimpleSingleCell analyses of skeletal muscle scRNA-seq data

This repository is coding for the manuscript: Proteogenomic single cell analysis of skeletal muscle myocytes by Fomchenko and Verma et al.

Full Jupyter notebooks are also available showing output from these codes.  These are available on request (but large!).
